# plutonium
A simple game engine.

Plutonium was made to give developers (especially me) much more overview in projects. 
Instead of concentrating on OpenGL commands, developers pay more attention to the game, 
which in some cases not only reduces the time needed to complete a project, but also improves the quality.
Plutonium is based on https://github.com/glfw/glfw and https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad and tries to be as efficent
as possible.

*DISCLAIMER: I have not created GLFW or GLAD and I'm not taking any responsibility for it. Likewise, GLAD and GLFW developers take no responsibility for plutonium. Use it at your own risk. This isn't GLFW. You can find it on it's official Website.*
