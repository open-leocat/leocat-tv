# plutonium
A simple game engine.

*plutonium* was made to give developers (especially me) much more overview in projects. 
Instead of concentrating on OpenGL commands, developers pay more attention to the game, 
which in some cases not only reduces the time needed to complete a project, but also improves the quality.

To download *plutonium* go to **plutonium.github.io**
